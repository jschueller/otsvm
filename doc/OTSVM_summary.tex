The purpose of this document is to present the OpenTURNS SVM module, which enables to realize support vector regression and classification with Libsvm and to manipualte results with OpenTURNS.

It offers to the user the ability to:
\begin{itemize}
 \item define a regression or a classification problem and solve it with Libsvm
 \item build OpenTURNS objects from Libsvm models
 \item extract metamodels of Libsvm as OpenTURNS metamodels
\end{itemize}


This document is organised according to the Open TURNS documentation :
\begin{itemize}
\item a \itshape{Reference Guide} which gives some theoretical basis on support vector regression.
\item a \itshape{Use cases Guide} which details scripts in python (the Textual Interface langage of Open TURNS) and helps the User to learn as quickly as possible the manipulation of the $otsvm$ module.
\item the \itshape{User Manual} which details the $otsvm$ objects and give the list of their methods.
\end{itemize}
